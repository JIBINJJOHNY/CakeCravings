## Design Overview:

At Cake Cravings, our design philosophy revolves around creating a visually appealing, user-friendly, and delightful experience for every visitor. We believe that the aesthetics of our platform should reflect the sweetness of the treats we offer. Here's an overview of our design principles:

  ![Color Scheme](documentation/color_scheme.png)
#### Typography Overview:

In crafting the visual identity of Cake Cravings, we've carefully selected fonts to enhance the overall aesthetic and readability of our platform.

1. 'Lato', sans-serif:

For another set of elements, we've opted for the 'Lato' font. Lato is a versatile sans-serif typeface chosen for its clean lines and modern appeal. It ensures readability and a contemporary look across different devices and browsers.

2. "Great Vibes", cursive:

This font brings a touch of elegance and handcrafted charm to specific elements on our website. If your device supports "Great Vibes," you'll experience a decorative and personalized feel. Otherwise, the browser will gracefully fall back to a generic cursive font for a consistent look.
